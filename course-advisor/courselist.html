</TR>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This course examines conceptions and misconceptions of the most enigmatic of our ancestors, the Neandertals. Since first discovered in 1848 Neandertals have occupied a special place in the story of human evolution - they have been pathologized, idealized, and romanticized. Neandertals have generated more
controversy surrounding human evolution than any other ancestor. This course examines aspects of biology, culture, symbolic behaviour, and subsistence, considering Neandertal origins and ‘disappearance,’ as well as considering how Neandertals have been represented in ‘popular culture’ over the past 150 years.

Excavation forms a central aspect of archaeology. As part of this course, students and community members will participate in a 6-8 week excavation of an archaeological locality. This will involve initial set-up of the area, excavation and record-keeping, and basic field laboratory procedures. In addition to "hands-on" participation, daily seminar discussion will be mandatory; topics will center on each day's survey and excavation results. These sessions will be interdisciplinary, reflecting the interests of the instructors, community members, visiting researchers and students. Topics will invariably focus on geomorphology, lithic artifacts, zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, paleoecology, oral traditions and Traditional Use, and the social context of conducting archaeology. The field school will often take place in remote localities in British Columbia and elsewhere, and so students may have to live in a field camp situation. In addition to basic tuition, there may be additional fees to cover camp and transportation costs.

The first part of this course focuses on animal bone identification, while the second part centers on theoretical aspects of animal use by pre-Industrial human societies. As part of this course, students may have to prepare animal skeletons.

This course engages students in the contemporary methodological and theoretical debates, and ideological challenges that face anthropologists today. Topics range from ethical considerations over the construction and ownership of knowledge to the practical challenges of how to set up a field/research project. This course prepares students to work within this ever-changing discipline through reinforcing the interlinked nature of sociocultural, biological and archaeological inquiry. Using an integrative approach, this course illustrates how our diverse theory, methods and practice may work together to challenge established rhetoric and create innovative ideas about the past, present and future.

<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This course introduces students to the "ways of knowing" that inform and shape the Humanities and Social Sciences. It is based on three main questions related to knowledge: What is it and how is it defined? How do we assess it? How do we communicate it? Related questions include: What forms does knowledge take? What counts as knowledge? Who has the power to define what counts as knowledge? Is there only one "truth?" How do we know what is credible? How do we share knowledge? Who gets to share knowledge? In other words, is knowledge political? What practices define the ways Humanities and Social Science disciplines define, assess and communicate knowledge? Student participation in "hands-on" learning is a key element of the course structure.

This course focuses on how people are shaped by and shape their worlds and where they live. People’s attachment to place is meaningful and the sense of place influences our identity and our social and cultural interactions with others and with the world. Different cultures and peoples within those cultures may hold various and diverse meanings of place. One person throughout their lifetime may even understand their place, and their place in the world, in different and changing ways. All of us are always “in place” somewhere. The goal of this course is to become aware of the impact “being in place” has on our lives and the lives of others by exploring the key concepts of place, identity and belonging.

This seminar considers international actions dealing with environmental problems such as climate change, ozone depletion, hazardous waste, POP's, war and the environment, fresh water quality, deforestation, biodiversity, and endangered species. Discussion focuses on the ways and the extent to which these problems can be met by international agreements, and governance arrangements, or what International Studies calls environmental "regimes". Two basic questions will be addressed: what factors facilitate the formation of international environmental regimes and can these regimes be effective while overcoming the "tragedy of the commons"?

</TR>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="ntdefault">
This seminar course critically questions and creatively reconsiders the nature of outdoor recreation activities as related to contemporary, and interrelated, social and environmental issues.  The course is firmly grounded in recreation and leisure studies literature offering anthropological, critical, historical, and socio-ecological interpretations of particular activities (e.g., canoeing, rock climbing, mountaineering), and involving concepts such as identity, place, skill, and community. The course may involve practical experiences and field trips to inform academic content, but these are not the focus.

ORTM 433 may be offered in conjunction with ORTM 333; in some years enrolment may be required in both. 

Note: ORTM 433 is typically a spring/summer course and therefore the ORTM Program encourages students not to take ORTM 433 in the spring of their 4th year. If a student chooses to take ORTM 433 in the spring of their 4th year there is no guarantee they will be able to use the credit for graduation in May of that year.
